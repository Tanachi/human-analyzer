  - Uncleansed raw data file in .csv format. Data collected over the 1st quarter in 2017.
  - Previous years 1st and 2nd quarter data.

### Challenge:
In data analysis projects, sometimes it takes hours of research to figure out what each column in the data set means. It may sometimes turn out that the data set you’re analyzing isn’t really suitable for what you’re trying to do. You may have an abundance of information or may need to research additional information to complete analysis.

#### Given the data provided, what analysis can be made for previous years?
Consider the Following:
  - What is the average participants per month, per year, per gender?
  - What is the average score per month?
  - What is the average per gender?
  - What month(s) have the biggest jump in participants?
  - What suggestions can you make based on the formatting of the data?

#### Given the data provided, what can you predictions can be made for the remainder of months in the 2nd quarter?
Consider the Following: 
  - Can the data provided from the previous years help in making meaningful predictions?
  - Are there any patterns you see?
  - How would you structure your data to make these predictions?

#### Create a report for the 2017 YTD data that stakeholders can easily read with cleansed data.
  - Your report can be submitted  in a google sheet, excel doc, google doc, or word doc.
  - Be creative, imagine you are presenting this to non-technical stakeholders. Think about visualizing your data.
  - Think about the data wholistically and separately, does it make sense to split your data up, does it make sense to have  multiple reports?

#### Summarize your findings to present to stakeholders in the company. Explain any trends and recommendations for improvement. 
  - Your summary may be submitted  in a google doc, pdf, or word doc.
  - Must include a summary of the data, what business issues are there (if any), your approach and process, and how you came to your findings. Summaries may also include any images, snapshots, links, or charts to help stakeholders interpret your findings.
